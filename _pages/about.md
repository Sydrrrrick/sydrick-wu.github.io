Hey there! I am a passionate third-year undergraduate student majoring in economics with a deep-seated interest in various fields including mathematics, microeconomics, macroeconomics, machine learning, and corporate finance.

During my most recent internship at Miracle Plus (former YC China), based in Beijing, China, where I held the role of Founders Relation, I spearheaded deal sourcing and conducted due diligence. My venture capital endeavors ignited my enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and cutting-edge technologies. I've honed my focus on artificial intelligence (LLM, NLP, AGI, AIGC, Agents), Web 3.0, Metaverse, and Blockchain technology, nurturing a strong desire to launch my own company in these innovative domains.

I consider myself as a versatile individual with a diverse skill set and a passion for cutting-edge technology projects. I am proficient in AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, DALL·E, Pica... alongside Python programming. I've cultivated a personal Xiaohongshu account to over 1000 followers. Additionally, I possess strong skills in data analysis and visualization, leveraging tools like Excel and PowerPoint to derive actionable insights, as well as video editing with Final Cut Pro X (FCPX), Adobe Premiere (PR), and ArcTime Pro.

My interests are diverse, spanning from vintage aesthetics to techno rave, jazz music, movies, and captivating visuals. Artistically, I am a signed photographer versed in PS/AI/LR for design layout and photo post-production, and I am a licensed sketch artist with a B-Level certificate.

As a certified Peer Listener, I am a compassionate communicator, skilled in Mandarin (First Language), English (IELTS-7.0), beginner of French, and I am currently learning Dutch.

Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I'm a passionate member of UNNC Rugby Varsity as a Wing player, with a keen interest in techno rave culture and frontier tech like XR VR technology, AI. Enthusiastic about sports, fitness, cycling, basketball, movies, and extensive travel experiences spanning 16 countries worldwide as an adventurer seeking new experiences abroad.

I am open to discussions and welcome any advice or opportunities. **Feel free to reach me out!**
