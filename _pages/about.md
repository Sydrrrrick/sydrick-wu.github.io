Hey there! I am a passionate third-year undergraduate student majoring in economics with a deep-seated interest in various fields including mathematics, microeconomics, macroeconomics, machine learning, and corporate finance.

During my most recent internship at Miracle Plus (former YC China), based in Beijing, China, where I held the role of Founders Relation, I spearheaded deal sourcing and conducted due diligence. My venture capital endeavors ignited my enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and cutting-edge technologies. I've honed my focus on artificial intelligence (LLM, NLP, AGI, AIGC, Agents), Web 3.0, Metaverse, and Blockchain technology, nurturing a strong desire to launch my own company in these innovative domains.

I consider myself as a versatile individual with a diverse skill set and a passion for cutting-edge technology projects. I am proficient in AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, DALL·E, Pica... alongside Python programming. I've cultivated a personal Xiaohongshu account to over 1000 followers. Additionally, I possess strong skills in data analysis and visualization, leveraging tools like Excel and PowerPoint to derive actionable insights, as well as video editing with Final Cut Pro X (FCPX), Adobe Premiere (PR), and ArcTime Pro.

My interests are diverse, spanning from vintage aesthetics to techno rave, jazz music, movies, and captivating visuals. Artistically, I am a **signed photographer** versed in PS/AI/LR for design layout and photo post-production, and I am a licensed sketch artist with a B-Level certificate.

As a certified Peer Listener, I am a compassionate communicator, skilled in Mandarin (First Language), English (IELTS-7.0), beginner of French, and I am currently learning Dutch.

Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I'm a passionate member of UNNC **Rugby Varsity** as a Wing player, with a keen interest in **techno rave** culture and frontier tech like XR VR technology, AI. Enthusiastic about sports, fitness, cycling, basketball, movies, and extensive travel experiences spanning **16 countries** worldwide as an adventurer seeking new experiences abroad.

I am open to discussions and welcome any advice or opportunities. **Feel free to reach me out!**
