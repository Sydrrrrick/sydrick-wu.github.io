Hey there! I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Economics](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/humanities-and-social-sciences/schools-and-department/economics/home.aspx), [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/). My research interest includes mathematics, microeconomics, macroeconomics, machine learning, and corporate finance.

My latest internship was deal sourcing and due diligence in Miracle Plus (previously YC China), based in Beijing, China. My passion spans a wide range of interests, including various sports, vintage aesthetics, techno rave, jazz music, movies, and captivating visuals. In my venture capital experiences, I've developed a keen focus on entrepreneurship, artificial intelligence (LLM, NLP, AGI, AIGC), Agents, Web 3.0, Metaverse, and Blockchain technology. I harbor a strong desire to eventually launch my own company in these exciting and innovative fields as well.

With my strong passion for travel, I have explored 16 countries as an adventurer seeking new experiences abroad after graduation of my middle school and I am currently learning Dutch and French. Any talk or advice is welcomed.
