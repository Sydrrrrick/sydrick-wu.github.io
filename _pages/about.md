Hey there! I'm a passionate third year undergraduate student majoring in economics. My research interest includes mathematics, microeconomics, macroeconomics, machine learning, and corporate finance.

My latest internship was Founders Relation taking in charge of deal sourcing and due diligence in Miracle Plus (former YC China), based in Beijing/Shanghai, China. My passion spans a wide range of interests, including cutting-edge technologies, various sports, vintage aesthetics, techno rave, jazz music, movies, and captivating visuals. In my venture capital experiences, I've developed a keen focus on entrepreneurship, artificial intelligence (LLM, NLP, AGI, AIGC, Agents), Web 3.0, Metaverse, and Blockchain technology. I harbor a strong desire to eventually launch my own company in these exciting and innovative fields as well.

With my strong passion for travel, I have explored 16 countries as an adventurer seeking new experiences abroad and I am currently learning Dutch and French. Any talk or advice is welcomed.
